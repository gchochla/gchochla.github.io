Welcome! You have wandered into my personal website. Here, you will find the latest and greatest news on moi. My name is Georgios Chochlakis. I have a M.Eng in Electrical & Computer Engineering from National Technical University of Athens (NTUA). My major was in Computer Science, which consists of the following flows: Flow L (Computer Software), Flow Y (Computer Systems) and Flow S (Signals, Control & Robotics). I did research on Deep Learning algorithms as part of my undergraduate diploma [thesis](http://artemis.cslab.ece.ntua.gr:8080/jspui/handle/123456789/17793), as I examined generative models in a [Zero-shot Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-shot_learning) setting.

You can also catch me at my Machine Learning blog, [*Thinking AIoud*](https://thinking-ai-aloud.blogspot.com/), where I examine basic Machine and Deep Learning concepts in depth.
