Welcome 👋! You have wandered into my personal website. Here, you will find the latest and greatest news on moi. My name is Georgios Chochlakis.

I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of Southern California and a graduate research assistant at the [Signal Analysis and Interpretation Laboratory](https://sail.usc.edu/), supervised by prof. [Shrikanth Narayanan](https://sail.usc.edu/people/shri.php). Previously, I studied for a joint M.Eng. and B.Sc. in Electrical ⚡ & Computer 🖥️ Engineering at National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), with a major in Computer Science. I did research on Deep Learning algorithms as part of my undergraduate diploma [thesis](http://artemis.cslab.ece.ntua.gr:8080/jspui/handle/123456789/17793) under the supervision of prof. [Alexandros Potamianos](https://slp.cs.ece.ntua.gr/potam/), where I examined generative models in a [Zero-shot Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-shot_learning) setting.

I am interested in ideas, not benchmarks. I am also interested in pretty much everything you can throw at me, from Computer Vision 👀, Generative modeling 🖼️, Reinforcement Learning 🤯, Conversational AI 🗣️ to their applications in Embodied AI and Robotics 🦿. 

You can also catch me at my Machine Learning blog, [*Thinking AIoud*](https://thinking-ai-aloud.blogspot.com/) 💭, where I examine basic Machine and Deep Learning concepts in depth.
