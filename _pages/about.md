Thank you for wandering into my personal webpage. My name is Georgios Chochlakis. I am a senior undergraduate student at National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), school of Electrical & Computer Engineering. My major is in Information Technology, which consists of the following flows: Flow L (Computer Software), Flow Y (Computer Systems) and Flow S (Signals, Control & Robotics). Currently, I am also a Deep Learning researcher at [NCSR Demokritos](https://www.iit.demokritos.gr/), working on satellite imagery and [DEMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_elevation_model).

Introductory steps
======
As I am setting out on my adventure in the Computer Science world, my main goal is to gather general knowledge and to begin to forge my path. Regarding this endeavor, I have taken courses in Robotics, Algorithms & Complexity, Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Computer Architecture among others, and a summer internship, focusing on Machine Learning.
