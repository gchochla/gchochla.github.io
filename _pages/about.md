Welcome üëã! You have wandered into my personal website. Here, you will find the latest and greatest news on moi. My name is Georgios (but please call me *Yiorgos*) Chochlakis.

I am a *Computer Science Ph.D. student* at the *University of Southern California* and a graduate research assistant at the [Signal Analysis and Interpretation Laboratory](https://sail.usc.edu/), supervised by prof. [Shrikanth Narayanan](https://sail.usc.edu/people/shri.php). I am currently working on multilingual emotion recognition from text on social media. I have developed emotion recognition methods that can be deployed in dynamic environments, such as multilingual settings, different desired emotions, and different annotation formats (e.g., transitioning from indinidual emotions to clusters of emotions). The defining feature of my approach is the ability to control extracted features by creating a label space along the input word embedding space. I am tangentially working on multimodal sentiment analysis in social media, where images are also included in the input.

Previously, I studied for a joint M.Eng. and B.Sc. in Electrical ‚ö° & Computer üñ•Ô∏è Engineering at the *National Technical University of Athens* (NTUA), with a major in Computer Science. I did research on Deep Learning algorithms as part of my undergraduate diploma [thesis](http://artemis.cslab.ece.ntua.gr:8080/jspui/handle/123456789/17793) under the supervision of prof. [Alexandros Potamianos](https://slp.cs.ece.ntua.gr/potam/), where I examined generative models in a [Zero-shot Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-shot_learning) setting.

I am also very much interested in scientific rigor and reproducibility, having replicated (or failed to do so) results from published work (see [here](https://github.com/gchochla/Deep-Representations-of-Visual-Descriptions) where I corrected an [error](https://github.com/gchochla/Deep-Representations-of-Visual-Descriptions/commit/bb5cfa3d27a7677bbbf16896a1917e9b5227596e) in the paper, [here](https://github.com/gchochla/capsules-utils), [here](https://github.com/gchochla/stackgan-pp), etc.). Beyond ML and CS, I find great pleasure in reading and hearing about Biology, Philosophy, Astronomy, and most other sciences.
