Welcome! You have wandered into my personal website. Here, you will find the latest and greatest news on moi. My name is Georgios Chochlakis. I am a senior undergraduate student at National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), school of Electrical & Computer Engineering. My major is in Computer Science, which consists of the following flows: Flow L (Computer Software), Flow Y (Computer Systems) and Flow S (Signals, Control & Robotics). I am currently doing research on Deep Learning algorithms as part of my undergraduate diploma thesis, as I examine multimodal embeddings and generative models in a [Zero-shot Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-shot_learning) setting.
