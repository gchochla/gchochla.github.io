Thank you for wandering into my personal webpage. My name is Georgios Chochlakis. I am a senior undergraduate student at National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), school of Electrical & Computer Engineering. My major is in Information Technology, which consists of the following flows: Flow L (Computer Software), Flow Y (Computer Systems) and Flow S (Signals, Control & Robotics). I am particularly keen on Machine Learning, general Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision. However, I do enjoy Software Development on any subject, provided it is challenging and the expected result exciting.

Introductory steps
======
As I am setting out on my adventure in the Computer Science world, my main goal is to gather general knowledge and to begin to forge my path. Regarding this endeavor, I have taken courses in Robotics, Algorithms & Complexity, Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Computer Architecture, etc... Also, I am currently a Machine-Learning-oriented intern in [SCiO Systems](https://scio.systems). Deciding my next steps is my main focus right now.
