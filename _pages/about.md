You have wandered into my personal webpage. Welcome! Here, you will find the latest and greatest news on moi. My name is Georgios Chochlakis. I am a senior undergraduate student at National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), school of Electrical & Computer Engineering. My major is in Computer Science, which consists of the following flows: Flow L (Computer Software), Flow Y (Computer Systems) and Flow S (Signals, Control & Robotics). Currently, I am also a Deep Learning researcher at [NCSR Demokritos](https://www.iit.demokritos.gr/), working on satellite imagery and [DEMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_elevation_model).
