excerpt: 'As new Deep Learning techniques and models are being developed, innovative ideas and the need to exploit them in useful applications in various academic disciplines arise. In our case, we considered using a conditional Generative Adversarial Network to predict 3D attributes (Digital Elevation Model) from satellite images. Specifically, we used the Pix2Pix algorithm which (during the training process) receives pairs of satellite and DEM images and then given a single satellite image, predicts a plausible DEM for it'
